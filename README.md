# BuffBlock
Author: Plask, (original Addon By Armilus).
**BuffBlock** is an addon that allows automatic removal of unwanted buffs. It has been ported to 1.13 classic WoW and I have added a lot of functionality, suggestions and bug reports can be posted in the issue tracker.
# Features #
A lot of buffs has been added to blockable, such as abolish spells, bloodthirst and all kinds of blessings. Since 1.13 API does not allow to remove buffs in combat automatically, they are only removed out-of-combat. If you are blocking a buff in combat, it will wait until combat drops and then remove it. It's also possible to automatically update/generate a chosen macro, which may do whatever you want such as casting sunder armor, starting auto attack and then removing all the buffs inside the macro. This macro can then be updated from the options and you can just have it on your actionbar all the time. Use the macro for removing buffs in combat too.
